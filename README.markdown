The purpose of Basic is to be a collection of solved exercises in basic computer science / programming.
I created it as a repository of the work I did while preparing for some job interviews - basically a collection of exercises, some solved more completely than others.

The excersices are taken from several places, most notably Google Code Jam. I hope you will find some of this useful.
